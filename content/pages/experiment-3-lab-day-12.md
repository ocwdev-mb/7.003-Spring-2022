### Day 12 Pre-Lab Notebook Tips & Reminders:

- Remember to include Aims for all parts (Parts 3.11 – 3.13)

### Day 12 Post-Lab Notebook Tips & Reminders:

- Be sure to label the gel photo such that it’s clear what is loaded in each lane and what the sizes of all ladder bands are.
- You should discuss each lane of your gel (lanes/samples with similar overall results can be discussed together as a group if you want).
    - What was the expected overall result for each lane? Why?
    - What can you conclude based on whether or not you saw the expected result for each lane? Explain your reasoning. If you did not get the expected results, what might be a possible reason to explain the difference?
- Record all spectrophotometer measurement/results and all DNA dilution calculations.
- Record which class sequencing sample numbers were assigned to your lab group and which mutant PCR was associated with each class number.
